Introduction

Share Pilot is a Social Media Post Management System (SMPMS). It enables you to share your posts across various channels on social media. With Share Pilot, you can schedule your posts for consistent and timely distribution across your social media platforms. Additionally, it allows you to maintain a history of your posts and manage their lifecycle effectively.

With Share Pilot, you can create multiple channels across your social media platforms. For instance, if you have several Facebook pages, Share Pilot allows you to set up separate schedules for posts on each channel. The system supports collaboration, enabling you to add multiple users to work on campaigns together.

The installation process is straightforward, allowing you to integrate it with your server, whether you're using WordPress, Joomla, or any other framework.

2. Access the Installation URL: In your browser, navigate to https://{my_domain_name}/sharepilot/install. Replace {my_domain_name} with your site's domain name, where 'sharepilot' is the script's directory name.
3. Database Configuration: Enter your database credentials, including the database host, username, password, and the database name. Also, set up the username and password for the Share Pilot admin account.
4. Run the Installer: Click the 'Install' button. If the installation is successful, you will be redirected to a confirmation page. If the installation fails, particularly due to database connection issues, check your settings or contact support for assistance.
5. Post-Installation Clean-up: After a successful installation, remove the 'install' folder from your server for security reasons.
6. Admin Login: Access the Share Pilot login page at https://{my_domain_name}/sharepilot and log in with the admin credentials you created.
7. Set Up a Cron Job: In your hosting control panel (such as cPanel), create a cron job. The cron job should point to the worker.php file within the 'cron' folder of Share Pilot. Configure the cron job to run every minute.
